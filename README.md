# Learning path: how to become a better programmer in IE

## Theory

It is asumed, that you know basics of CS: what compiler is, what are variables, data structures etc. And you are familiar with at least one programming language.

## Javascript

* [Javascript: Understanding the weird parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts) 3.5 hrs of good insights and deep explanations.
* [70 Javascript interview questions](https://dev.to/macmacky/70-javascript-interview-questions-5gfi) practical questions you will encounter not only in interviews, but in real life too.
* [Katas: tdd-based way to learn javascript](https://jskatas.org/#bundle-es6-katas) A good way to get you hands dirty, and practice JS. You have to have knowledge about the pieces you practicing, so better try it after first two. 
* For the laughs: [JS Wat](https://archive.org/details/wat_destroyallsoftware). I was crying after this one, seriously..

## TypeScript

Video courses/introduction:

* [Short version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBPrJSw7yQA) Very short one, even shorter after skipping the intro. Touches some interesting points later though.
* [Long (complete) version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwuLxPH8IDs) more than 3 hrs of complete course. Requires some dedication. I usually watch those ant 1.25x speed.

Language reference:

* [Quick Intro](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
* [Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) Go through it all, it is quite readabe. You will find something new for sure.

## React

* [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) Especially the video!
* [Official guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)

## Tracking

This list is not mandatory, like everything is. But to track the state of the team you could use table like this:
